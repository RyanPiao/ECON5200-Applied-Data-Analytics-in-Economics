# 📊 Economic Data Science Portfolio

Welcome! This repository showcases my journey in **Applied Data Analytics for Economics** (ECON 5200), where I bridge traditional economic theory with modern machine learning techniques.

## About This Portfolio

As a graduate economics student specializing in **Economic Consulting**, I'm building expertise at the intersection of causal inference and predictive analytics. This portfolio demonstrates how classical econometric methods can be extended and enhanced through data science—transforming foundational concepts like OLS regression into scalable machine learning frameworks like Lasso and Ridge regression.

The projects here reflect a **"Concept Extension"** philosophy: starting with rigorous economic theory, then scaling up with computational tools to handle real-world complexity. Whether it's forecasting market trends, estimating treatment effects, or uncovering hidden patterns in economic data, I aim to combine the interpretability of traditional econometrics with the power of modern algorithms.
